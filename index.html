        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, I am Aaliyah Escobar, I am a current student at the University of California Riverside. I am currently a first year undergraduate student and  my major is currently undeclared. In high school I had a span of two jobs. When I just turned 16 I got a job at In-N-Out, where I worked there for a year and a half, quitting around the middle of my senior year in high school. Throughout working at In-N-Out, I received many new skills, as well as earning 4 promotions that allowed me to work around the second highest level for employees my age. The skills I acquired were excellent customer service, managing cash registers and transactions, taking food orders and handing them out, and preparing and serving food in the kitchen. All of those skills allowed me to be confident and hardworking due to the fact that In-N-Out is a very fast paced environment with high demand. After I graduated high school, I got a job at a retail store, Zumiez, where I was able to handle transactions, returns, organizations, cleanliness, and awareness. Although it was a seasonal job, I learned many valuable skills that allowed me to be who I am today in the working world.<br><br>

        Before I worked my two jobs that I have had, I was a straight A student in high school. I also attended clubs and was involved with high school sports. Since I did many activities I was able to manage my time very well with hard work and responsibility. Once I got my first job in high school, I had to manage school, my job, clubs, and sports altogether. I was able to do all of that while maintaining a 4.0 and higher GPA. I was also very involved in classes, participating, helping other students, and always reminding myself of homework deadlines and tests that were coming up. With sports, I always attended practices and games, I always went to team bonding events and dinners, as well as forming close bonds with my teammates. Although I left behind soccer in high school, I am really glad that I was able to participate and be on the team because it feels even better when you are a high honor athletic student that earned high honor roll and the Cum Laude sash during graduation. <br><br>

        I have mainly talked about work and school, but I will introduce myself properly. I am a 18 year old college student that is living on campus. My passion and hobbies are art and reading. I love to buy books all the time and grow my collection of literature and fiction. I have a large collection of manga and romance novels that I annotate as I read. As a full time college student I always put my studies first. I enjoy the feeling of being able to take a rest day when all my work and readings are completed, it makes me feel accomplished and proud of where I am today. Thank you for taking the time to read my bio.
